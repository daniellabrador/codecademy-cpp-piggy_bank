# **Piggy Bank**

The Piggy Bank program converts the amount entered by the user (from COP, BRL, and PEN) and display the total amount of USD. This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus), has been an invaluable exercise in applying the knowledge I learned in learning to declare variables using C++.

## Project Prompt

You just returned from a trip to South America. The countries you visited were Colombia, Brazil, and Peru. You arrived back in your country with some foreign currencies from these three countries.

Write a C++ program called currency.cpp that prompts the user for the amount of each foreign currency. Your prompts should look like:

```git
Enter number of Colombian Pesos:
Enter number of Brazilian Reais:
Enter number of Peruvian Soles:
```

Your program should then convert the amount entered by the user and display the total amount of USD. Your final output should look like:

```git
US Dollars = $______
```

## Technologies

- C++

## Setup

Generally, you would want to compile and execute the program locally. To do that:

1. Download `currency.cpp`.
2. Open the terminal or command line and navigate to the directory where the downloaded file resides.
3. Run the following commands to compile and execute the program:

```git
g++ currency.cpp -o currency
./currency
```
